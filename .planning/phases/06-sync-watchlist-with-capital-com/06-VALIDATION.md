# Phase 06 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | Playwright |
| **Config file** | playwright.config.ts |
| **Quick run command** | `npx playwright test tests/e2e/watchlist-sync.spec.ts` |
| **Full suite command** | `npx playwright test` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~15 seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `npx playwright test tests/e2e/watchlist-sync.spec.ts`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `npx playwright test`
- **Before `/gsd-verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** 15 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*
*(No formal requirements mapped for this phase)*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

*Existing infrastructure covers all phase requirements.*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|

*All phase behaviors have automated verification.*

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [x] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [x] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [x] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [x] No watch-mode flags
- [x] Feedback latency < 15s
- [x] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter
